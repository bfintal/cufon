# Cufon (forked for GambitTech WP themes)

I have 2 main problems with the current tagged version of Cufon:

1. Doesn't support retina displays
2. Foreign characters are impractical (large file size or there are no fonts for them)

This fork solves both of these and integrates 2 repos:
1. Solved by Cufon's master copy (2012-12-26)
2. Solved by <a href='https://github.com/oori/cufon'>Oori's fork</a>
